  ##
  # This is a powerful and versatile class representing a color. It provides 
  # simultaneous usage of RGBA, HSV/HSB, and HSL colorspaces through a single
  # interface.
  #
  # When using via the RGBA colorspace, it accepts both 0-255 integer values, or
  # float values from 0.0 to 1.0. 
  #
  # @note All specified values are clamped within their respective ranges.
  # @note Internally this class is represented as a 32-bit structure, using an
  #   unsigned 8-bit value (0-255) for each component, in RGBA byte-order.
